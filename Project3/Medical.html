        <h1>Important Milestones:</h1>
    </center>
        <p>
            Birth to 1 month: During this time, babies may lift their head briefly while on their stomach, respond to
            loud noises, and follow an object with their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            1 to 3 months: Babies at this age may be able to lift their head and chest while on their stomach, bring
            their hands to their mouth, and make cooing noises.
        </p>
        <p>
            4 to 6 months: At this age, babies may be able to roll over, sit with support, and bring objects to their
            mouth. They may also begin to make more vowel sounds and babble.
        </p>
        <p>
            7 to 12 months: During this time, babies may be able to crawl, pull themselves up to a standing position,
            and make more distinct sounds. They may also be able to understand simple commands and point to objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            ---It's important to keep in mind that every baby is different, and it's normal for babies to develop at
            their own pace. If you have concerns about your baby's development, it's a good idea to consult with a
            healthcare provider.

        <h2> Health concerns</h2>
    </center>
        <p>
            There are many common health concerns that can arise when raising a baby. Here are a few examples:
        </p>
        <p> Infections: Babies are at increased risk of infections due to their immature immune systems. Common
            infections in babies include respiratory infections, ear infections, and gastrointestinal infections.
        </p>
        <p> Allergies: Babies can develop allergies to a variety of substances, including food, environmental allergens,
            and medications. Symptoms of allergies in babies can include skin rash, vomiting, and difficulty breathing.

        </p>
        <p> Developmental delays: Babies develop at their own pace, but if a baby is not reaching developmental
            milestones or is showing signs of developmental delays, it may be a sign of an underlying health problem.
        </p>
        <p> Sleep problems: Many babies have difficulty sleeping through the night, and this can be a common concern for
            parents. Sleep problems in babies can be caused by a variety of factors, including discomfort, hunger, or
            developmental issues.

        </p>
        <p> Feeding problems: Some babies may have difficulty breastfeeding or bottle-feeding, or may have feeding
            issues related to allergies or other health problems.
        </p>
        <p> If you have concerns about your baby's health, it's important to consult with a healthcare provider for
            proper diagnosis and treatment.

            <h2> Dangers of baby powder</h2>
        </center>
        <p>
            Baby powder is a cosmetic product that is used to reduce skin irritation and moisture. Some baby powders
            contain talc, which is a mineral that can be inhaled and has been linked to respiratory problems and cancer.
            Other baby powders use cornstarch or other ingredients that are generally considered safe.
        </p>
        <p>
            The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends avoiding the use of talc-based baby powders and other
            products that may be inhaled by infants and young children. The AAP recommends using cornstarch-based
            powders or other products that do not contain talc if you need to use a powder on your baby.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to keep in mind that baby powder is generally not necessary for newborns, and there are often
            alternative ways to address skin irritation or moisture. If you have concerns about using baby powder or any
            other product on your newborn, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider for guidance.

            <h2> Rashes</h2>
        </center>
       
        <p>
            There are many types of rashes that can affect babies, and some can be a sign of an underlying health
            problem. Here are a few rashes to be aware of:
        </p>
        <p>
            Diaper rash: This is a common type of rash that affects the skin in the diaper area. It is usually caused by
            irritation from wet or soiled diapers, and it can be treated with diaper cream or ointment.
        <p>

            Eczema: This is a chronic skin condition that causes dry, itchy skin and can appear as a rash on the face,
            arms, or legs. It is often treated with moisturizers and topical medications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Heat rash: This is a rash that appears when the sweat glands are blocked and sweat becomes trapped under the
            skin. It is common in hot, humid weather and can be treated by keeping the affected area cool and dry.
        </p>
        <p>

            Impetigo: This is a contagious bacterial infection that causes red, itchy sores on the skin. It is treated
            with antibiotics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Measles: This is a viral infection that causes a rash of red, raised spots on the skin. It is highly
            contagious and can be serious, especially in young children.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you notice any unusual rash on your baby, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider for
            proper diagnosis and treatment.
