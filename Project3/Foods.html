        <center><h2>Breast Milk Vs Formula</h2></center>           
     <div class="w3-container w3-border w3-large">        
      <p> Breast milk is the natural, optimal source of nutrition for infants. 
           It contains a perfect balance of nutrients and antibodies that help protect infants against infection and disease. 
           Breast milk also contains hormones and other substances that promote the growth and development of the infant's brain 
            and other organs.</p>
        <p>
        Formula is a man-made alternative to breast milk that is fed to infants when breast milk is not available or when a woman chooses not to breastfeed. 
        Formula is made from a variety of ingredients, including proteins (such as cow's milk or soy), fats, carbohydrates, and added vitamins and minerals. 
        While formula can provide adequate nutrition for infants, it is not a complete substitute for breast milk and does not have the same health benefits.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Biggest Take-aways</h3>
        <div class="w3-container w3-border w3-large"> 
           <p> In general, breastfeeding is recommended as the best source of nutrition for infants. 
            However, there are situations in which formula may be necessary or preferred, 
            such as when a woman is unable to produce enough breast milk or when a baby has a medical condition that requires a special type of formula. 
            If you are considering using formula for your infant, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best option for your individual situation.</p>

            <h2 class="w3-center">Foods</h2>
            <div class="w3-left-align"><p>
            There are many healthy options to consider when introducing solid foods to a child. Here are some ideas:</p></div>
            
            
            <div class="w3-left-align"><p>
            Pureed fruits and vegetables: Start with single-ingredient purees and gradually introduce combinations. 
            Some options include applesauce, avocado, banana, sweet potato, and peas.</p></div>
            
            <div class="w3-left-align"><p>
            Whole grains: Offer cooked grains such as rice, quinoa, or oats. 
            These can be mashed or cut into small pieces for your child to pick up and eat.</p></div>
            
            <div class="w3-left-align"><p>
            Lean protein: Offer small amounts of cooked and mashed beans, tofu, chicken, or fish.</p></div>
            <div class="w3-left-align"><p>
            Healthy fats: Offer small amounts of avocado, olive oil, or nut butters (if your child is not allergic).
            Dairy: Offer small amounts of yogurt or cheese once your child is comfortable with other solid foods.
            </p></div>
            <div class="w3-left-align"><p>
            It's important to remember to introduce new foods one at a time, in small amounts, and to watch for any signs of allergies. 
            It's also a good idea to offer a variety of foods to ensure that your child is getting a balanced diet.
            </p></div>
