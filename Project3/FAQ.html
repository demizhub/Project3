        <h2>First time parenting mistakes to avoid</h2>
    </center>
    <div class="w3-container w3-border w3-large">
        <p> Being a first-time parent can be overwhelming, and it's normal to make mistakes. Here are a few common
            mistakes that first-time parents might make, and some suggestions for how to avoid or minimize them:
        </p>
        <p>
            Not asking for help: Many first-time parents feel like they should be able to do everything on their own,
            but it's okay to ask for help. Don't be afraid to accept offers of help from family and friends, or to hire
            a babysitter or postpartum doula.
        </p>
        <p>Comparing yourself to others: Every child is different, and every parent has their own unique style. It's
            important to focus on what works best for you and your child, rather than comparing yourself to others.
        </p>
        <p>Not sleeping when the baby sleeps: It can be tempting to try to catch up on household tasks when the baby is
            sleeping, but it's important to prioritize your own rest.
        </p>
        <p>Not setting boundaries: It's important to set boundaries with your child and with others (such as family
            members or babysitters) to ensure that you have time to take care of yourself and to build a healthy,
            nurturing relationship with your child.
        </p>
        <p>Not seeking out support: Being a parent can be isolating at times, and it's important to seek out support
            from other parents, friends, or professionals if you need it.
        </p>
        <p>Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and the most important thing is to learn from them and do your best to
            provide a loving and nurturing environment for your child.
        </p>

        <h2>Common Misconceptions</h2>
    </center>
    <div class="w3-container w3-border w3-large">
        <p>
            Newborns sleep all the time: While it's true that newborns sleep a lot, they don't sleep for long stretches
            at a time. Newborns typically sleep for about 16-17 hours per day, but they may only sleep for 1-3 hours at
            a time.
        </p>
        <p>All newborns are the same: Every newborn is unique and will have their own individual patterns of sleeping,
            eating, and developing.
        </p>
        <p>Breastfeeding is easy: While breastfeeding can be a natural and rewarding experience for many mothers, it can
            also be challenging and require time and effort to establish a good milk supply and a comfortable latch.</p>
        <p>
            Newborns should be on a strict schedule: It's important to provide a consistent routine for your newborn,
            but it's okay to be flexible and follow your baby's cues.
        </p>
        <p> Newborns don't need much stimulation: Newborns are learning and developing quickly, and they can benefit
            from appropriate and age-appropriate stimulation.
        </p>
        <p>It's important to remember that every newborn is different and to seek out reliable sources of information
            (such as a healthcare provider) to help guide you through the early weeks and months of parenting.
        </p>
        </p>
    </div>
    <center>
        <h2>Good sources</h2>
    </center>
    <div class="w3-container w3-border w3-large">
        <p>
            Healthcare providers: Your baby's healthcare provider is a valuable source of information and can answer
            your questions and provide guidance on a wide range of topics related to your baby's health and development.
        </p>
        <p>Parenting books and websites: There are many books and websites available on parenting, and some of these can
            be a helpful source of information. However, it's important to be selective and to choose sources that are
            based on scientific evidence and written by qualified professionals.
        </p>
        <p>Parenting classes and support groups: Many hospitals and community centers offer parenting classes or support
            groups, which can be a great way to connect with other parents and to learn more about raising a baby.
        </p>
        <p>Friends and family: Your friends and family members who have raised children can be a valuable source of
            support and advice. However, it's important to remember that what worked for them may not work for you, and
            to be open to trying different approaches.
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately, the most important thing is to trust your own instincts and to do what feels right for you and
            your baby.
        </p>
